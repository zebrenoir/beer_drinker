# Beer Drinker
## A not very corporate web app

Picture that:    

You are a 20 year-old student, you go out with your friends in a pub after a long and hard day at the university.  
You really want to get drunk tonight.  
Only problem: when your hand reaches your pocket, you realize that you only have
a few pounds left (or dollars or euros or whatever, come on!).  
Therefore, you will have to be strategic when you order your beers.  
Not only you cannot afford a lot of beers, but the few you will drink need to get you drunk effectively.    

Well, lucky you are! ***Beer drinker*** will exactly serve this purpose:    

You enter the beers you want to drink and their price, and *Beer Drinker* will output the best beer regarding the alcohol / price ratio. Handy, isn't it?
